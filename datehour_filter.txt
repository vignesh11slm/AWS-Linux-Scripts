To filter a column named `datehour` in Redshift based on specific date ranges, you can use the `TO_DATE` function along with the `BETWEEN` operator. Here's how you can filter for yesterday, the last week, and the last two weeks:

1. Filter for Yesterday:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM your_table
WHERE TO_DATE(datehour, 'YYYYMMDDHH24') = current_date - interval '1 day';
```
This query compares the `datehour` column after converting it to a date format (YYYYMMDDHH24) with the current date minus one day.

2. Filter for Last Week:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM your_table
WHERE TO_DATE(datehour, 'YYYYMMDDHH24') BETWEEN current_date - interval '1 week' AND current_date - interval '1 day';
```
This query uses the `BETWEEN` operator to filter the `datehour` column within the range from the current date minus one week to the current date minus one day.

3. Filter for Last Two Weeks:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM your_table
WHERE TO_DATE(datehour, 'YYYYMMDDHH24') BETWEEN current_date - interval '2 weeks' AND current_date - interval '1 day';
```
This query filters the `datehour` column within the range from the current date minus two weeks to the current date minus one day.

Replace `your_table` with the actual name of your table containing the `datehour` column. Running these queries will return the rows where the `datehour` value falls within the specified date ranges.


To filter the `datehour` column for the current month in Redshift, you can utilize the `TO_DATE` function and date functions available in Redshift. Here's how you can achieve this:

Filter for Current Month:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM your_table
WHERE DATE_TRUNC('month', TO_DATE(datehour, 'YYYYMMDDHH24')) = DATE_TRUNC('month', GETDATE());
```
This query truncates the `datehour` column to the month level using the `DATE_TRUNC` function, and compares it with the truncated current month obtained from `GETDATE()`.

Replace `your_table` with the actual name of your table containing the `datehour` column. Running this query will return the rows where the `datehour` value falls within the current month.

Note: The `GETDATE()` function is used to obtain the current date and time in Redshift. If you need to use the current date only (without considering the time), you can use `CURRENT_DATE` instead of `GETDATE()`.

Make sure to adjust the time zone settings if necessary to match your desired time zone.
