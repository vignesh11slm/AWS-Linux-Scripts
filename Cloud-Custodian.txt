I got the error "The role defined for the function cannot be assumed by Lambda" because i had not updated the roles "Trust Relationship" config file. I didn't encounter the timeout issues as in the linked answer in the comments.

The comments in the above answers pointed out that you need to add the following.

Go to 'IAM > Roles > YourRoleName'
(Note: if your role isn't listed, then you need to create it.)
Select the 'Trust Relationships' tab
Select 'Edit Trust Relationship'
Mine ended up like the below.

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      <your other rules>
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "lambda.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
